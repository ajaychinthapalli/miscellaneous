# MinIO to Cloudian Cutover for GitHub Enterprise

## 1. Preparation
- **Assessment**: Evaluate the current use of MinIO, including storage size, bucket structure, and access patterns.
- **Planning**: Create a detailed plan that includes timelines, roles, and responsibilities for the cutover process.
- **Backup**: Ensure that all data in MinIO is backed up to prevent any data loss during the transition.

## 2. Environment Setup
- **Provision Cloudian**: Set up the Cloudian environment, ensuring it meets the requirements for GitHub Enterprise.
- **Configuration**: Configure Cloudian settings to match those used in MinIO, including bucket policies, access controls, and any other relevant settings.

## 3. Data Migration
- **Data Transfer**: Use data migration tools or scripts to transfer data from MinIO to Cloudian. Ensure data integrity and consistency during the transfer.
- **Verification**: Verify that all data has been successfully transferred and is accessible in Cloudian.

## 4. GitHub Enterprise Configuration
- **Update Storage Settings**: Change the storage settings in GitHub Enterprise to point to Cloudian instead of MinIO.
  - Access the GitHub Enterprise management console.
  - Navigate to the storage settings and update the endpoint, access key, and secret key to those of Cloudian.
- **Testing**: Perform thorough testing to ensure that GitHub Enterprise can read from and write to Cloudian without issues.

## 5. Rollout and Monitoring
- **Cutover**: Schedule and execute the cutover during a maintenance window to minimize the impact on users.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor the system closely after the cutover to identify and resolve any issues that may arise.

## 6. Post-Cutover Activities
- **Validation**: Validate that all functionalities are working correctly and that there are no performance issues.
- **Documentation**: Document the cutover process, including any issues encountered and their resolutions, for future reference.

## 7. Communication
- **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform all relevant stakeholders about the cutover process, including the timeline and any expected downtime.
- **User Training**: Provide necessary training or documentation to users about any changes in accessing data due to the transition.

## Tools and Resources
- **Data Migration Tools**: Look into tools like `rclone`, `s3cmd`, or custom scripts for data transfer.
- **Cloudian Documentation**: Utilize Cloudianâ€™s documentation for configuration and best practices.
- **GitHub Enterprise Support**: Engage with GitHub Enterprise support for any assistance needed during the transition.
